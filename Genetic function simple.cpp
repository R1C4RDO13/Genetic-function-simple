//function to test  x + 3 – sin(x)


//for the generic algorithm we need to encode our number into bits
//we need to convert the floating points into bits
//Than we select a range (low - max) (0 , 4)
//the search space needs to be bounded, we cannot look in a infinite number of solutions

//we set a number of bits that we will use (ex: 8 bits), number of chromosomes
//we need to calculate the precision, (high - low) / (2^n - 1)
                            // n = 8bits (0 - 255)

//decode (i is from 0 to the number of bits)
    //SUM( bit_value_i * 2^i) * precision + low

//the decode process is parsing the bits to a decimal value
